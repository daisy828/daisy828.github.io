                Exo (Korean: 엑소; stylized as EXO) is a South Korean-Chinese boy group based in Seoul. Formed by S.M. Entertainment in 2011, the group debuted in 2012 with twelve members separated into two subgroups, EXO-K and EXO-M, performing music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively. EXO rose to fame with the release of their best-selling first album XOXO (2013), which contained the breakthrough hit "Growl". XOXO was a critical and commercial success, winning both Disk Daesang at the 28th Golden Disk Awards and Album of the Year at the 15th Mnet Asian Music Awards. It eventually went on to sell over one million copies, putting EXO as the best-selling Korean artist in twelve years.[1] Their third EP Overdose (2014) made EXO the highest-charting Korean male act on the Billboard 200.[2] EXO were later ranked the most influential celebrity by Forbes Korea for the year 2014.[3] In 2015 EXO broke their previous Billboard record with the release of their second studio album EXODUS, which became the highest charting album for a male K-pop group on the Billboard 200 as well the K-pop album with the highest first week sales.[4] EXODUS's title track "Call Me Baby" also earned the honor of becoming the first and only K-pop track to enter the Canadian HOT 100.[5] EXODUS later went on to sell more than one million copies, earning EXO the title, "double million sellers." Their fourth EP Sing For You (2015) later broke EXODUS's first week sales record by selling 267,900 copies in its first week.[6] In early 2016, EXO were revealed to have again ranked as the most powerful celebrity by Forbes Korea for the year 2015.[7]
